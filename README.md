### PTFramework

PTFramework is a framework that is designed to implement the core functionality of the business logic of the PlayTime application. 

Play Time is a productivity app which will replace conventional timers with exciting custom timers, it will allow users to set up tasks and allocate a duration for each of these tasks, it will then use the Apple Music API to generate a playlist based on user taste which will last for the duration of the task they set.
